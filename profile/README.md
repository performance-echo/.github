# Hello Performance Team! :rocket:

This is Echoenergia's Performance team GitHub page. Here we have repositories for the main codes used by the team, most of them being in the format of python packages that can easily be installed using pip.

Feel free to contribute! All code that at some point can be reused by someone is recommended to be in here for better version control.

Please check out the [Documentation](https://github.com/performance-echo/documentation) section. A lot of useful information can be found there.
